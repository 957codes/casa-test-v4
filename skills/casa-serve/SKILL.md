description: Drain the Console work queue. The interactive founder runs this to execute the intents the dashboard queued (run a node, refine with chat, score, advise, resolve a gate), one at a time, dispatching each to the matching skill and closing it through the deterministic brain. Use when the user types casa-serve, when a hook nudges them that work is queued, or when they ask to process the dashboard queue.

# casa-serve

The work queue drain. The Console bridge (console/bridge.mjs) is a mailbox: a click
in the dashboard appends a WORK intent to `company-brain/console/queue.jsonl` and
returns. The bridge never executes it. This skill is the executor, and the executor
is the PRESENT founder. They typed `/casa-serve` (or a SessionStart or notification
hook nudged them), so every run is interactive and subscription-safe. casa-serve
never spawns `claude -p`, never runs a background agent, and never auto-loops without
the founder. It picks up one queued intent, does the real work by dispatching to the
existing skills, and ends each completed node in `brain.mjs complete` so the
deterministic engine re-renders and the dashboard updates.

## The queue contract

`company-brain/console/queue.jsonl` is append-only, one intent per line:

```json
{ "id": "...", "ts": "...", "kind": "build|chat|review|next|resolve-gate",
  "nodeId": "<id>", "payload": { "message": "...", "decision": "approve|changes" },
  "status": "pending|running|done|error", "result": "..." }
```

The latest record per `id` wins. The bridge wrote the original `pending` row. You
advance an intent ONLY by APPENDING a new status row with the same `id`; never
rewrite or delete an earlier line. The reader (the bridge `/api/queue`) collapses to
the latest record per id, so a one-field append like `{ "id", "ts", "status" }`
merges over the original.

## Steps

1. Pick the intent. If the founder named an id, take it. Otherwise read the queue and
   take the OLDEST `pending` intent (collapse to the latest row per id first, exactly
   like the bridge):

   ```
   node -e 'const fs=require("fs"),p="company-brain/console/queue.jsonl";if(!fs.existsSync(p)){console.log("");process.exit(0)}const m=new Map();for(const l of fs.readFileSync(p,"utf8").split("\n")){const s=l.trim();if(!s)continue;try{const r=JSON.parse(s);m.set(r.id,{...(m.get(r.id)||{}),...r})}catch{}}const q=[...m.values()].filter(r=>r.status==="pending").sort((a,b)=>String(a.ts).localeCompare(String(b.ts)));console.log(q.length?JSON.stringify(q[0]):"")'
   ```

   If it prints nothing, tell the founder the queue is empty and stop.

2. Mark it running. Append a status row (do not rewrite earlier lines):

   ```
   node -e 'const fs=require("fs"),p="company-brain/console/queue.jsonl";fs.appendFileSync(p,JSON.stringify({id:process.argv[1],ts:new Date().toISOString(),status:"running"})+"\n")' <intentId>
   ```

   Log a first activity line (step 4 shape) so the dashboard shows the node is moving.

3. Dispatch by kind. Do the actual work in THIS session; these are real LLM jobs, not
   deterministic shells.

   - `build` -- run the `casa-build` skill on `payload.nodeId`. Do the real work to its
     quality bar and write the deliverable under `company-brain/outputs/<nodeId>/`
     (this is where the grade mode reads it). Then run `casa-review grade <nodeId>`
     (the grade mode below) to score it. Then close the node:

     ```
     node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/brain.mjs complete company-brain <nodeId>
     ```

   - `chat` -- a per-node refinement. Read the node's current deliverable under
     `company-brain/outputs/<nodeId>/` and the founder's `payload.message` (also
     recorded in `company-brain/console/messages.jsonl` as the user row). Produce the
     REFINED deliverable and rewrite that output file in place. Run `casa-review grade
     <nodeId>` to re-score. Append an assistant row to messages.jsonl summarizing what
     changed (shape in step 5). A chat refinement does not flip node status; it
     improves an existing deliverable.

   - `review` -- run the `casa-review` grade mode (below) on `payload.nodeId`. It
     writes the score to `company-brain/console/scores.jsonl`; surface the score,
     pass or fail, and the gaps.

   - `next` -- run the `casa-next` skill and deliver its reasoned briefing. Advisory
     only; it changes no node state.

   - `resolve-gate` -- read `payload.decision`. `approve` means the founder eyeballed
     the node and approves it: close it with
     `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/brain.mjs complete company-brain <nodeId>`.
     `changes` means re-run `casa-build` on the node with the founder's change note
     (`payload.message`) as the instruction, write the revised deliverable under
     `company-brain/outputs/<nodeId>/`, re-grade, then complete.

4. Log activity as you work. Append per-node activity lines so the dashboard live feed
   shows progress (one at the start, one or two mid-run, one at the end):

   ```
   node -e 'const fs=require("fs"),pa=require("path"),p="company-brain/console/activity.jsonl";fs.mkdirSync(pa.dirname(p),{recursive:true});fs.appendFileSync(p,JSON.stringify({nodeId:process.argv[1],ts:new Date().toISOString(),text:process.argv[2]})+"\n")' <nodeId> "<short progress line>"
   ```

5. For a chat intent, append the assistant reply to messages.jsonl:

   ```
   node -e 'const fs=require("fs"),pa=require("path"),p="company-brain/console/messages.jsonl";fs.mkdirSync(pa.dirname(p),{recursive:true});fs.appendFileSync(p,JSON.stringify({id:Date.now().toString(36),nodeId:process.argv[1],role:"assistant",content:process.argv[2],intentId:process.argv[3],ts:new Date().toISOString()})+"\n")' <nodeId> "<what changed in the deliverable>" <intentId>
   ```

6. Close the intent. Append a final status row (`done` with a short result, or `error`
   with the reason). Same append-only rule, same `id`:

   ```
   node -e 'const fs=require("fs"),p="company-brain/console/queue.jsonl";fs.appendFileSync(p,JSON.stringify({id:process.argv[1],ts:new Date().toISOString(),status:process.argv[2],result:process.argv[3]})+"\n")' <intentId> done "<one-line result>"
   ```

   If anything failed (a missing input, a blocked node, a non-ready node), set
   `error` with the reason instead of forcing the work. Do not invent a deliverable.

7. Deliver the payoff, then loop. After a build, chat, or approved resolve-gate that ran
   `brain.mjs complete`, the deterministic engine already re-rendered build-map.json,
   NOW.md, and the company CLAUDE.md AUTO blocks, and the bridge fired an SSE. Close the
   loop OUT LOUD so the founder feels the forward motion (this is what earns the next
   session). Print, in one tight block:
   - SHIPPED: the node title and its grade (e.g. "Marketplace Liquidity Balancing -- 82, passed").
   - UNLOCKED: read the re-rendered NOW.md / build-map.json and name what this just made
     ready (the downstream nodes that flipped from blocked to ready).
   - NEXT MOVE: the new top of NOW.md -- the single highest-leverage thing to do now.
   Tell the founder the dashboard already reflects all of this (the move advanced, momentum
   ticked, the win is in Recently shipped). Then OFFER to drain the next pending intent.
   Wait for the founder to say go. Never auto-spawn the next run; the founder stays in the loop.

## The JSONL you write (so the bridge and UI can read them)

- `company-brain/console/queue.jsonl` -- status rows, append-only, keyed by the
  existing intent `id`: `{ "id", "ts", "status": "running|done|error", "result"? }`.
  Latest row per id wins. Never rewrite earlier lines.
- `company-brain/console/messages.jsonl` -- the assistant reply to a chat intent:
  `{ "id", "nodeId", "role": "assistant", "content", "intentId", "ts" }`.
- `company-brain/console/activity.jsonl` -- the per-node progress feed:
  `{ "nodeId", "ts", "text" }`.
- `company-brain/console/scores.jsonl` -- written by the grade mode (casa-review),
  not here directly: `{ "nodeId", "score", "pass", "gaps": [...], "ts" }`.

## Rules

- Only the deterministic engine writes brain state (rule 4). A click or an intent
  never flips a node's status directly. Node status changes go through
  `brain.mjs complete`; the queue, messages, activity, scores, and outputs files are
  request and artifact state OUTSIDE build-map.json, state.json, and profile.json.
- The executor is the present founder's interactive session (rule 5). Never spawn
  `claude -p`, never run a headless or background agent, never auto-drain the queue.
  One intent, then ask before the next.
- Any money step routes through `casa-pay` (rule 8). Surface Capx Pay's quote, get the
  founder's explicit confirmation, and never invent a price or a limit. Without Pay,
  degrade to the bring-your-own-key or manual path and record the outcome.
- Never auto-execute a human-gate, irreversible, legal, or money step inside a build.
  Stop and surface it, exactly as casa-build does.
- Append, never rewrite, the JSONL files. The latest record per id wins by design.
- No em-dashes, no emojis in any founder-facing output.
